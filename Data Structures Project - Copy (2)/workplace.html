            <p style="font-family: Futura T Light;font-size: 25px; text-align: justify;"> Racism in the workplace is a concept as old as work itself. 
                Judging an individual's capacity to complete work, be viable for a certain type of work, or who they can work with based on their race 
                are just some examples of the struggles which victims of workplace racism may face. The abhorrent action of workplace racism leads to a 
                social structure within the workplace that actively puts minorities at a major disadvantage.
                Working to disassemble this cruel pattern which has no place in society is a large scale effort. Education and remediation are two steps which can help with building a more inclusive workplace environment.</p>

                Workplace racism is extremely prevalent across the globe. Strong examples of this are cases such as that of Marcus Boyd who 
                worked at a General Motors plant in Ohio. Marcus, a black man, faced daily racial harassment to the highest degree. 
                From heavy usage of the n-word in the workplace by white coworkers to death threats and nooses tied in the break room. 
                Marcus made complaints to his managers of the situation and was told to deal with it himself. This persisted until Marcus
                 began to fear for his own safety at work to the point of quitting the job at his mothers request.

            <p style="font-family: futura t light; font-size: 25px; text-align: justify;"> Moving towards a full inclusive and racism free workplace should be the
                 final goal. Racism has no place within the world let alone our workplaces where it hinders productivity and the mental health of workers.
                  If you have been the victim of an incident of workplace racism you should take action, no matter how severe the transgression was.
                   From microaggressions to severe cases such as that of Marcus Boyd do not be complacent when it comes to dealing with racism in the workplace. 
                   Take immediate action by reporting the offense to the correct authorities such as a human resources department of even the police in extreme cases. 
                   As a workplace manager attempting to curb workplace racism, implement technologies such as those made by ClearView Connects which allows employees
                    to anonymously report workplace incidents of any nature.  </p>
