  This is a meditative website dedicated to aiding and teaching individuals on how to deal with racism-related issues created by ICS4U0 students Hisham Nasir, Mohammed Mawi, and Mudar Abuzar. People may feel powerless when confronted with racism, therefore we provide resources to aid them in dealing with such circumstances. We can help with a wide range of issues that people may be facing. For example, in the form class, we have a range of racism-related topics that we can help the user with. The form class prompts the user to select from a variety of subjects that addresses the problem that the user is dealing with. After they select a topic, the website redirects them to a page that elaborates on what that issue is, examples of that issue, and, ultimately, how we can overcome that issue. The last meditative pages provide a relaxing soundscape and an engaging stress-relieving experience that helps the user forget about the stressful racism they have experienced.
